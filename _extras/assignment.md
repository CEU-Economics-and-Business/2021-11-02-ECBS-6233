## Task

> The deadline is 11pm (Vienna time) on Friday, **January 14**.

Feel free to consult class notes, Google, StackOverflow, each other, but **type each line of code you write on your own**. No copy-pasting, please.

Show all your work in a public GitHub repository. (Please start a new one.) 

### Track 1
1. Take a paper to replicate. Pick one [from here](https://www.i4replication.org/reports.html), [here](https://zenodo.org/communities/restud-replication), or anywhere you like. The paper can use any programming language.
2. Download its replication package and commit it to a new GitHub repository. 
3. Make necessary changes to improve the reproducibility of the paper. (See list below.)
4. Document these changes in commits with meaningful commit messages. Push changes to GitHub.
5. Submit the link to your repository to complete the assignment. (If your data is too large to add to GitHub or you want to keep it private, please give very specific instructions about how we can get it.)

### Track 2
1. Take a research project you are working on (not someone else's).
2. Create a new project folder and git repository.
3. Get the raw data. Document where it is coming from (see list below).
4. Write code to clean data.
5. Conduct some analysis that produces some exhibit (table or figure). The specific econometric method does not matter, may be a simple histogram or comparison of means.
6. Document these changes in commits with meaningful commit messages. Push changes to GitHub.
7. Submit the link to your repository to complete the assignment. (If your data is too large to add to GitHub or you want to keep it private, please give very specific instructions about how we can get it.)


## Learning Outcomes to Demonstrate
1. Whenever usage terms permit, data is included.
2. Data is cited properly (https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/addtl-data-citation-guidance.html).
3. Data cleaning code is included.
4. Analysis code is included.
5. Codes are sufficiently modular to understand what does what. For Stata, this means each .do file does one thing. For other programming languages, this means each function does one thing.
6. A Makefile executes the codes in the correct order.
7. The Makefile uses automatic variables or pattern matching.
8. Exhibits are included as files.
9. Code, data and exhibits are properly organized in folders.
10. Files, functions and variables are appropriately named. (https://zenodo.org/record/5383489)
11. Each git commit does one thing.
12. Commit messages are helpful.

## Grading
### Class Participation
The maximum score for class participation is 40.

Rubric | Score
---|---
Attended 80% of classes, was active in most | 40
Attended 80% of classes, was active in some | 35
Attended 80% of classes, was inactive | 30
Attended 50% of classes | 25
Attended some classes | 20

### Coding Assignment
The maximum score for the coding assignment is 60. The score only depends on the number of learning outcomes demonstrated, not the quality of the analysis question and the project.
